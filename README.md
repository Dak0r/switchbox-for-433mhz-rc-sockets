# Switchbox for 433mh Radio Controlled Sockets
 Arduino Sketch for a simple universal remote box for 433mhz sockets with 5 dip switches. 
 House Code is hardcoded, up to 32 sockets can be controlled by entering the socket code 
 using switches connected to pinA - pinE and pressing a button connected to pinOn or pinOff.
 Requires RC-Switch Library (also in Arduino Lib Manager): https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch/
